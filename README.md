## 📖 Project Overview

Traditional laboratories require manual operation of electrical appliances, leading to unnecessary power consumption and reduced convenience. This project introduces an IoT-enabled automation system that allows users to control laboratory lights and fans from anywhere using the Blynk mobile application.

The system is built around the ESP32 microcontroller, which connects to the internet via Wi-Fi and communicates with the Blynk Cloud for real-time appliance control.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. ESP32 connects to the Wi-Fi network.
2. The ESP32 establishes communication with the Blynk Cloud.
3. Users control laboratory appliances through the Blynk mobile application.
4. Commands are transmitted to the ESP32 in real time.
5. The ESP32 activates or deactivates the corresponding relay.
6. The relay switches the connected light or fan ON/OFF.
7. Users can control individual appliances or operate all lights and all fans simultaneously using master controls.
